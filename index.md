I received my Bachelor of [Space Engineering](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/academics/space-engineering) from the [Lassonde School of Engineering](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/), [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/), where I designed and implemented a soil sample collector for a rover participating in the [Canadian International Rover Challenge](https://circ.cstag.ca/) under the supervison of [Franz Newland](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/users/franz-newland).

My passion is to apply creative engineering solutions to mechanical and aero-space problems. I have successfully completed many projects using advanced CAD tools, such as SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Abaqus FEA, and Siemens NX for design analysis, stress analysis, and fatigue analysis. Moreover, I am experienced in programming and data analysis in MATLAB and Python.
