- 2022
  - Soil Sample Collector
    - Conceptualized and designed sustainable solutions for drilling, collecting, and storing different soil samples for a rover participating in Canadian International Rover Challenge
    - Communicated with stakeholders and costumers, drafted project documentations at various stages of product development including Preliminary Concept Review (PCR), and delegated tasks to team members based on their qualifications and capabilities to ensure an appropriate design
    - Utilized SolidWorks to create the final solution and conducted comprehensive environmental testing, safety assessments, and fault analysis, including thermal testing, to validate equipment performance under diverse conditions.

- 2022
  - Load Carrying Truss Design
    - Developed a structural truss system crafted from Steel and Aluminum to provide robust support for a 3000 N load.
    - Employed advanced engineering methodologies, including fatigue analysis, fracture mechanics, stress analysis, and mass efficiency assessment, utilizing Abaqus Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software.
    - Implemented MATLAB program to automate the truss nodal displacement process

- 2021
  - SpaceCraft analysis
    - Analyzed physical and surface properties of different materials used on a CubeSat, to compute thermal loads applied to its surfaces while orbiting the Earth
    - Measured cold and hot heat dissipation using Siemens NX software for a better understanding of heat behavior for different materials in space and vacuum for durability checks

- 2020
  - Boeing 787 wing flaps
    - Designed the aileron flaps inspired by Boeing 787 wing flaps
    - Animated the trajectory and the motion from closed to fully open
    - Optimized the link length and the degree of freedom
    - Programmed the mechanism to take input from the potentiometer and cycle through max and min extentions automatically
