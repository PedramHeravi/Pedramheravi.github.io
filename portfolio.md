  - Rooftop Anchor Upgrades: Elevating Safety

In this project, a total of 16 rooftop anchors were installed to enhance safety during elevated work. After a thorough assessment, four (4) of these anchors were modified with a 45-degree bend design. This modification allows workers to secure their safety ropes directly to the U-bar instead of the flat based of the anchor, minimizing the risk of rope damage and prioritizing safety. These anchor enhancements not only boost safety measures but also optimize operational efficiency, facilitating smoother and more secure rooftop work procedures.

  - Anchor and Davit Arm Load Testing

As part of anchor load testing process, we use specialized procedures to make sure the system can safely handle a 2500 lb load, all in line with strict safety rules. The process begins with a detailed evaluation of anchor points, where we conducted a comprehensive assessment to ascertain their load-bearing capacities. This step is essential to understand the system's current state and identify potential vulnerabilities.

In the documentation phase, we provide detailed reporting of the entire load testing procedure. This documentation encompassed every facet of our evaluation, including the methodologies employed, the results obtained, and, most importantly, our recommendations. These recommendations are instrumental in guiding future maintenance efforts or, if necessary, the replacement of anchors that dont meet the requisite load-bearing criteria.

  - Soil Sample Collector

In my capstone project, I played a pivotal role in conceptualizing and designing sustainable solutions for the drilling, collection, and storage of various soil samples, essential for a rover's participation in the prestigious Canadian International Rover Challenge. My responsibilities extended beyond design, involving effective communication with stakeholders and customer to gather requirements and feedback. I documented the project's progress through various stages, including the Preliminary Concept Review (PCR), and assigned tasks to team members based on their qualifications and capabilities, ensuring that our design aligns with the intended objectives.
To bring the project to fruition, we harnessed SolidWorks as our primary design tool, crafting the final solution. Rigorous testing and validation were performed, encompassing comprehensive environmental assessments, safety evaluations, and fault analysis.

  - Load Carrying Truss Design

In this competition, I took the lead in developing a structural truss system that was crafted using a mix of steel and aluminum materials. The goal of this project was to make sure my design could support a 3000 N load. Achieving this meant diving deep into some advanced engineering methods, like fatigue analysis, fracture mechanics, stress analysis, and mass efficiency assessment.

To ensure the truss's structural integrity and performance under varying conditions, I employed Abaqus Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, conducting rigorous simulations and analysis.
To further streamline and enhance the project's efficiency, I used programming by implementing a MATLAB program. This program automated the complex process of calculating nodal displacements within the truss system, improving accuracy and reducing manual effort.

  - SpaceCraft analysis

In this project, a comprehensive analysis of the physical and surface properties of various materials employed in the construction of a CubeSat was conducted. The primary objective was to calculate the thermal loads exerted on the CubeSat's surfaces during its orbital journey around Earth. This entailed a carefully look at thermal conductivity, emissivity, and other traits of each material.

Siemens NX software was instrumental in assessing the heat dissipation capabilities of these materials under extreme conditions, including both cold and hot scenarios encountered in space and vacuum environments. This examination provided valuable insights into the behavior of different materials in the harsh space environment, aiding in durability checks.

  - Boeing 787 wing flaps
 
In this project, I had the exciting challenge of designing aileron flaps, drawing inspiration from the advanced wing flap system used in Boeing 787 aircraft. I also delved into animation to visually illustrate how these aileron flaps move. I visually depicted the trajectory and motion of these aileron flaps, showcasing their transition from a closed position to full openness. To ensure optimal functionality, I engaged in the critical process of link length and degree of freedom optimization, fine-tuning the mechanisms to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.
