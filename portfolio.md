- 2022
  - Soil sample collector
    - Conceptualized and designed sustainable solutions for drilling, collecting, and storing different soil samples for a rover involved in Canadian International Rover Challenge
    - Communicated with stakeholders and costumers, drafted project documentations at various stages of product development including PCR, and assigned tasks to team members based on their qualifications and abilities to guarantee a suitable design
    - Designed the final solution in SolidWorks and conducted environmental testing, safety and fault analysis, including thermal to validate the performance of equipment under different conditions

- 2021
  - SpaceCraft analysis
    - Analyzed physical and surface properties of different materials used on a CubeSat, to compute thermal loads applied to its surfaces while orbiting the Earth
    - Measured cold and hot heat dissipation using Siemens NX software for a better understanding of heat behavior for different materials in space and vacuum for durability checks
