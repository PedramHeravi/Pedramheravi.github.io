- 2022
  - Soil sample collector
    - Conceptualized and designed sustainable solutions for drilling, collecting, and storing different soil samples for a rover involved in Canadian International Rover Challenge
    - Communicated with stakeholders and costumers, drafted project documentations at various stages of product development including PCR, and assigned tasks to team members based on their qualifications and abilities to guarantee a suitable design
    - Designed the final solution in SolidWorks and conducted environmental testing, safety and fault analysis, including thermal to validate the performance of equipment under different conditions

- 2022
  - Load Carrying Truss Design
    - Designed a truss structure constructed out of Steel and Aluminum material to support and carry a 3000 N load
    - Applied fatigue analysis and fracture mechanics, stress analysis and mass efficiency analysis using Abaqus FEA
    - Implemented MATLAB program to automate the truss nodal displacement process

- 2021
  - SpaceCraft analysis
    - Analyzed physical and surface properties of different materials used on a CubeSat, to compute thermal loads applied to its surfaces while orbiting the Earth
    - Measured cold and hot heat dissipation using Siemens NX software for a better understanding of heat behavior for different materials in space and vacuum for durability checks

- 2020
  - Boeing 787 wing flaps
    - Designed the aileron flaps inspired by Boeing 787 wing flaps
    - Animated the trajectory and the motion from closed to fully open
    - Optimized the link length and the degree of freedom
    - Programmed the mechanism to take input from the potentiometer and cycle through max and min extentions automatically
