  - Rooftop Anchor Upgrades: Elevating Safety
In this project, a total of 16 rooftop anchors were installed to enhance safety during elevated work. Following a thorough assessment, four (4) of these anchors were modified with a 45-degree bend design. This modification allows workers to secure their safety ropes directly to the U-bar of the anchor, minimizing the risk of rope damage and prioritizing safety. These anchor enhancements not only boost safety measures but also optimize operational efficiency, facilitating smoother and more secure rooftop work procedures.

  - Anchor and Davit Arm Load Testing
In this project, we employed specialized Anchor Load Testing procedures as a critical step in verifying the system's ability to safely support a substantial 2500 lb load, thereby ensuring full compliance with stringent safety regulations. The process began with a meticulous evaluation of anchor points, where we conducted a comprehensive assessment to ascertain their load-bearing capacities. This step was essential to understand the system's current state and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Our commitment to precision extended to the documentation phase, where we provided detailed reporting of the entire load testing procedure. This documentation encompassed every facet of our evaluation, including the methodologies employed, the results obtained, and, most importantly, our recommendations. These recommendations were instrumental in guiding future maintenance efforts or, if necessary, the replacement of anchors that did not meet the requisite load-bearing criteria.

  - Soil Sample Collector
In this project, I played a pivotal role in conceptualizing and designing sustainable solutions for the drilling, collection, and storage of various soil samples, essential for a rover's participation in the prestigious Canadian International Rover Challenge. My responsibilities extended beyond design, involving effective communication with stakeholders and customers to gather requirements and feedback. I meticulously documented the project's progress through various stages, including the Preliminary Concept Review (PCR), and assigned tasks to team members based on their qualifications and capabilities, ensuring that our design aligns with the intended objectives.
To bring the project to fruition, I harnessed SolidWorks as our primary design tool, meticulously crafting the final solution. Rigorous testing and validation were cornerstones of our approach, encompassing comprehensive environmental assessments, safety evaluations, and fault analysis.

  - Load Carrying Truss Design
In this project, I spearheaded the development of a structural truss system meticulously crafted from a combination of steel and aluminum materials, engineered to provide exceptional support for a substantial 3000 N load. This endeavor demanded the application of advanced engineering methodologies, including fatigue analysis, fracture mechanics, stress analysis, and mass efficiency assessment. To ensure the truss's structural integrity and performance under varying conditions, I employed Abaqus Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, conducting rigorous simulations and analysis.
To further streamline and enhance the project's efficiency, I leveraged my skills in programming by implementing a MATLAB program. This program automated the complex process of calculating nodal displacements within the truss system, improving accuracy and reducing manual effort.

  - SpaceCraft analysis
In this project, a comprehensive analysis of the physical and surface properties of various materials employed in the construction of a CubeSat was conducted. The primary objective was to calculate the thermal loads exerted on the CubeSat's surfaces during its orbital journey around Earth. This entailed a meticulous examination of each material's thermal conductivity, emissivity, and other pertinent characteristics to model and predict heat transfer in space conditions accurately.

Furthermore, Siemens NX software was instrumental in assessing the heat dissipation capabilities of these materials under extreme conditions, including both cold and hot scenarios encountered in space and vacuum environments. This detailed examination provided valuable insights into the behavior of different materials in the harsh space environment, aiding in durability checks.

  - Boeing 787 wing flaps
In this project, I took on the task of designing aileron flaps, drawing inspiration from the sophisticated wing flap system employed in Boeing 787 aircraft. My role extended beyond design to include animation, where I visually depicted the trajectory and motion of these aileron flaps, showcasing their transition from a closed position to full openness. To ensure optimal functionality, I engaged in the critical process of link length and degree of freedom optimization, fine-tuning the mechanisms to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.
